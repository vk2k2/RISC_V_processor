# RISC_V_processor
Single stage Harvard architecture RV32I instruction set processor. Has been implemented on a Boolean board FPGA with a simple program using on-board switches, buttons and LEDs. It has a clock speed of 10MHz.

constrs_1/imports/Downloads has the constraints file for boolean board.

sim_1/new has the testbench I used to verify operation.

sources_1/new has all verilog code for the processor. It also has the program + RAM memory in hex form.

ricv_program.txt Is the program in assembly code.
